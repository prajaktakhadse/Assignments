QUE:-   What is the difference between the Checked and Unchecked exceptions explain it
        with an example? 
        
        
answer-
        Checked Exception:-
              This Exception are checked at compile-time by complier if there is any syntactical error.
              And it is handled by try-catch block.
              For example:- IOException,SQLException, etc.
              
                import java.io.IOException;
				public class Main {
	
				public static void validate(int age)throws IOException {
				if(age<18) {
	
				throw new IOException("Person is not eligible to vote");
				}
				else {
				System.out.println("Person is eligible to vote!!");
				}
				}
	
				public static void main(String args[]){
	
				try {
				validate(13);
				} catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
				}
				System.out.println("rest of the code...");
				}
				}
			
              
        Unchecked Exception:-
              This Exception are checked at run-time . This exception occurs due to bad data provided 
              by the user.. In simple words, if a program throws an unchecked exception,and even if
              we didn’t handle or declare it, the program would not give a compilation error.
              For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.

             public class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {

				public InsufficientFundsException() {
			
				}
			
				public InsufficientFundsException(String message)
				{
					super(message);
				}
